**Crucial Instructions:**
- **Storytelling:** The report must flow logically. Use headers, bold text, bullet points, and blockquotes to make it highly readable.
- **Markdown Formatting:** Use Markdown syntax correctly. Pay special attention to image tags `![alt text](path)`.
- **Dynamic Content:** You must dynamically insert the content from the JSON summary and the visualization paths into the template.
- **Completeness:** The final output must be a single, complete Markdown document containing all sections. Do not omit any part of the template.
- **Tone:** Maintain a professional, objective, and clear tone throughout the report.
- **Placeholder Replacement:** Replace all bracketed placeholders `[like this]` with the actual content from the inputs. For file paths, use the exact paths provided. Add the current date.
- **No JSON:** Your output must be pure Markdown text, not a JSON object.
