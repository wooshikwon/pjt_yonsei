PLANNING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert statistician and data analyst. Your task is to create a detailed, step-by-step statistical analysis plan based on the user's request and the provided data context. The plan must be robust and follow sound statistical principles.

**User's Request**:
{user_request}

**Data Context**:
- Data Schema: {data_schema}
- RAG Context: {rag_context}

Based on this information, generate a numbered list of all the necessary steps to fully address the user's request. The plan must include:
1.  **Data Preprocessing**: Necessary filtering, cleaning, or transformation.
2.  **Pre-tests**: Assumption checks like normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk), homogeneity of variance tests (e.g., Levene's test), or multicollinearity checks, if applicable.
3.  **Main Statistical Test**: The core test to answer the user's question (e.g., T-test, ANOVA, Linear/Logistic Regression, Chi-squared test, Correlation, Proportion Test).
4.  **Post-hoc Analysis / Model Evaluation**: Post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD), effect size calculations (e.g., Cohen's d), or model performance evaluation (e.g., R-squared, confusion matrix), if the main test is significant or a model is built.

Your output must be ONLY the numbered list of steps. Do not include any other text or explanation.

**### EXAMPLES OF ANALYSIS PLANS ###**

**Example (T-test for two groups)**
*User Request: "A팀과 B팀의 성과 차이가 있는지 분석해줘"*
1. Filter the data for 'team' column values 'A팀' and 'B팀'.
2. Perform Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on the 'sales_total' column for 'A팀'.
3. Perform Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on the 'sales_total' column for 'B팀'.
4. Perform Levene's test for homogeneity of variances between the two teams' 'sales_total' data.
5. Based on the results of the pre-tests, execute an Independent Samples T-test or Welch's T-test.
6. Calculate Cohen's d to determine the effect size of the difference.

**Example (ANOVA for three or more groups)**
*User Request: "A, B, C 세 팀 간의 고객 만족도에 유의미한 차이가 있는지 알려줘."*
1. Filter the data to include only 'A팀', 'B팀', 'C팀'.
2. Check for and handle any missing values in the 'satisfaction_score' column.
3. Perform Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on 'satisfaction_score' for each of the three teams.
4. Perform Levene's test for homogeneity of variances across the three groups.
5. If assumptions are met, perform a One-way ANOVA test. Otherwise, suggest a Kruskal-Wallis test.
6. If the ANOVA result is statistically significant, perform a Tukey's HSD post-hoc test to identify which specific teams differ from each other.

**Example (Correlation Analysis)**
*User Request: "고객 만족도, 재방문 의사, 그리고 평균 구매 금액 사이에는 어떤 상관관계가 있는지 분석해줘."*
1. Select the continuous variables for analysis: `satisfaction_score`, `revisit_intention`, `avg_purchase_amount`.
2. Handle any missing values for these columns, for instance, by using listwise deletion.
3. Check for linear patterns and outliers by examining descriptive statistics and extreme values for each variable.
4. Calculate the Pearson correlation matrix for the selected variables to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationships.
5. Print the correlation matrix with coefficients and their statistical significance (p-values).
6. Interpret the key correlation coefficients from the matrix, highlighting their strength, direction, and statistical significance.

**Example (Linear Regression)**
*User Request: "광고비와 웹사이트 방문자 수가 매출에 어떤 영향을 미치는지 분석해줘."*
1. Define the independent variables ('ad_spend', 'website_visitors') and the dependent variable ('revenue').
2. Check for missing values in all relevant columns and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
3. Check for multicollinearity between independent variables using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
4. Check for linearity by examining correlation coefficients between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
5. Fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression model using `statsmodels.api`.
6. Print the model summary to evaluate the overall model fit (R-squared) and the significance of each variable (p-values).
7. Perform residual analysis by calculating residual statistics to check for homoscedasticity and normality assumptions.

**Example (Logistic Regression)**
*User Request: "고객의 나이와 월간 구매 횟수가 구독 서비스 이탈(churn) 여부를 예측할 수 있는지 분석해줘."*
1. Define independent variables ('age', 'monthly_purchases') and the binary dependent variable ('churn').
2. Encode the dependent variable 'churn' into 0 (no churn) and 1 (churn).
3. Handle any missing values in the feature columns.
4. Standardize the independent variables using `StandardScaler` since they are on different scales.
5. Fit a Logistic Regression model using `statsmodels.api.Logit`.
6. Print the model summary, including Pseudo R-squared.
7. Calculate and print the odds ratios (OR) for each variable by taking the exponent of the coefficients, to interpret their influence on the likelihood of churn.
8. Evaluate the model's predictive performance using a confusion matrix, accuracy, and precision/recall scores.

**Example (Chi-squared Test)**
*User Request: "학력 수준(고졸, 대졸, 대학원졸)에 따라 선호하는 제품 플랜(베이직, 스탠다드, 프리미엄)에 차이가 있는지 궁금해."*
1. Select the two categorical variables: 'education_level' and 'preferred_plan'.
2. Create a contingency table (crosstab) to show the frequency distribution of these two variables.
3. Perform a Chi-squared test of independence on the contingency table using `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency`.
4. Check the expected frequencies from the test result to ensure the validity of the test (no cell with expected frequency < 5).
5. If the result is statistically significant, calculate Cramér's V to measure the strength of the association between the two variables.
6. Analyze the standardized residuals of the contingency table to identify which specific cells (combinations of education and plan) contribute most to the significant result.

**Example (Two-Proportion Z-Test)**
*User Request: "A/B 테스트 결과, A디자인과 B디자인의 클릭률(CTR)에 통계적으로 유의미한 차이가 있는지 검정해줘."*
1. Filter the dataset to separate group 'A' and group 'B'.
2. For group A, count the number of successes (e.g., clicks) and the total number of trials (e.g., impressions).
3. For group B, count the number of successes (clicks) and the total number of trials (impressions).
4. Perform a two-proportion z-test using `statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest`, providing the counts of successes and trials for both groups.
5. Print the resulting z-statistic and the p-value from the test.
6. Based on the p-value (e.g., compared to an alpha of 0.05), conclude whether there is a statistically significant difference in click-through rates between the two designs.

CODE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a senior Python data scientist. Your task is to write a single, executable Python script to perform a specific step in a data analysis plan.

**Full Analysis Plan**:
{analysis_plan}

**Current Step to Implement**:
{current_step}

**Context**:
The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame named `df`. You have access to libraries like `pandas`, `scipy.stats`, and `statsmodels.api`.

**CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS - FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY**:
❌ NEVER use any visualization commands:
   - Do NOT use: plt.show(), fig.show(), plotly.show()
   - Do NOT use: plt.savefig(), fig.savefig(), any image saving
   - Do NOT use: plt.plot(), sns.plot(), any plotting functions
   - Do NOT create: graphs, charts, plots, figures, or visual outputs

✅ INSTEAD, provide numerical summaries:
   - Use print() statements for statistical results

   - Report exact numerical values (means, p-values, coefficients)
   - Create text-based tables using tabulate or formatted strings

Write only the Python code for the "Current Step to Implement". Do not add any explanations, comments, or introductory text. The code should be immediately executable. Your code's output (from `print()` statements) will be used as the input for the next step, so ensure you print any important results like p-values, test statistics, or conclusions.
